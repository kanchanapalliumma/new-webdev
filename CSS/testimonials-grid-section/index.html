                   I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
                   The entire curriculum and stuff did not disappoint.They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
                   The agile team project,in particular,was outstanding.It look my learning to the next level in a way that
                    no tutorial could ever have.In fact,I've often reffred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience.It certaintly helped me
